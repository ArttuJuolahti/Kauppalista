## About The App
Kauppalista is an app that allows users to create and manage a shopping list. The app enables users to add items to the list, mark them as purchased, or remove them. Data is stored in the browser's localStorage, ensuring the list persists even after the page is refreshed.


## Technologies
I used the following technologies:
- `HTML`: For structuring the application
- `CSS`: For styling and responsive design
- `JavaScript`: For functionality and user interaction
- `localStorage`: For storing and persisting the list data across sessions

## Setup
1. Download or clone the repository:
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser
3. Start using the app by adding, marking, and removing items from the list

## Status
The shopping list app is functional and works well. New features, such as item editing and improved UI, will be included in the next update.
